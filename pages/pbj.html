    <p><em>How tasty! What nostalgia! This classic sandwich can be made in a flash!</em></p>
    <h4><strong>Base Ingredients:</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Peanut Butter</li>
        <li>Jelly or Jam</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>Optional Ingredients:</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>In place of (or in addition to) peanut butter, you can use any number of spreads:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Nutella</li>
            <li>Cashew Butter</li>
            <li>Almond Butter</li>
            <li>Soft Chocolate Ganache</li>
            <li>Apple Butter</li>
        </ul>
        
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>Steps:</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread the peanut butter evenly on one face of a slice of bread</li>
        <li>Spread the jelly/jam evenly on one face of another slice of bread</li>
        <li>Place one slice on the other such that the peanut butter and jelly are touching, and the bread slices are aligned</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Additional Considerations:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Some humans like their PB&J sandwiches divided prior to consumption. This is most effectively done <em>after</em> the sandwhich has been assembled</li>
        <li>If you plan on enjoying the sandwich later, you may find that the jam/jelly will cause the bread to become soggy. To avoid finding yourself in such a situation, you may put a thin layer of peanut butter on the slice of bread designated for Jelly, before applying the Jelly.</li>
