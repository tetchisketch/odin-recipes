    <p><em>This easy-to-make dish is made from kitchen staples and will likely become one of your favorites too! </em></p>

    <h4><strong>Base Ingredients:</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Dried Pasta (my favorite for this is fusilli, but just about any variety can work)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Parmeasan (the real stuff, please!) + some for finishing/garnish</li>
        <li>1/3 cup Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 Tbs Butter</li>
        <li>1 Lemon (Zest and Juice)</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Black Pepper (freshly ground)</li>
        <li>3 minced Garlic Cloves</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><strong>Optional Ingredients:</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Anchovies</li>
        <li>Spices (Coriander Seed, Cardamom, Fennel Seed, or whatever floats your boat!)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped Red Onion </li>
        <li>1/4 cup halved or quartered Cherry Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Any Cheeses you need to use up from the fridge</li>
        <li>Chicken or Veggie stock (in-place of water)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><strong>Steps:</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>While the water for the pasta is heating to a boil, prepare the ingredients.</li>
        <li>When the pasta goes into the boiling water, begin the preparation of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet on medium heat, add the garlic, black pepper, and anchovies (if using).</li>
        <li>When the Garlic begins to turn slightly golden, add any additional spices to be used, and bloom for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the Parmesean cheese and 1/4 cup of the pasta water. Stir to Combine</li>
        <li>When the pasta is cooked al dente, strain and add to the sauce, tossing to coat.</li>
        <li>Add the butter and lemon juice and toss to combine. Once the Butter is melted and combined, take the pan off the heat.</li>
        <li>Add the lemon zest, tomatoes, onions (if using), and any additional cheese to taste.</li>
        <li>Toss to combine, serve, and enjoy!</li>
        
    </ol>

    <h4>Additional Considerations:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>If the pasta is done before the sauce, simply save 1/4 cup of the pasta water and strain the pasta to stop it from cooking further.</li>
        <li>If the sauce is done before the pasta, take the pan off the heat until the pasta is ready.</li>
        
    </ul>
